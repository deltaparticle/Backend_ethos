# Professor/Course Rating System - Backend

This is the backend component of the **Professor/Course Rating System**, designed to handle data collected from student responses and store it on a local blockchain using **Ganache**. The data is then accessed via **The Graph** protocol, enabling efficient querying and retrieval of reviews.

## Features (In Progress)
- **Data Storage on Local Blockchain**: All ratings and reviews are securely stored on a local blockchain using **Ganache**.
- **Query with The Graph**: Data is accessed using **The Graph** protocol, allowing efficient retrieval and summarization of reviews.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **Ganache**: Installed and running for local blockchain development.
- **The Graph**: Set up for querying data.
